Hey man I'm counting on you
We're all in this together
So dont let me down
Everything i do - i do for you
For you - So i'll be around
I'll be around - I'll be around
So dont let me down - dont let me down

She run away But i dont care
She wont come Cuz she already there

I love to hate her I hate to love her
I stand behind I rise above her
Yeah, chase em all away We chase em all away
Chase em all away We chase em all away
Love to hate her I hate to love her
I stand behind I rise above her

Remember, Remember
We're all in this together
So dont let me down
Everything i do - i do for you
For you - so i'll be around

She walk away But i dont care
She do her nails And she dye her hair

I love to hate her I hate to love her
I stand beside I rise above her
Yea, chase em all away We chase em all away
Chase em all away We chase em all away
I love to hate her I hate to love her
I stand beside I rise above her

Remember, Remember
We're all in this together
So dont let me down
Everything i do - i do for you
For you - so i'll be around

Come on baby take a chance on me
Come on baby have a dance with me tonight
